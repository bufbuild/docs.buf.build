Without the [BSR](../bsr/overview.md) depending on other Protobuf APIs is a painful, manual process.
For example, if you want to use [googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis)
you're expected to clone the Git repository and manually copy the `.proto` file(s) you
need in order to compile your `.proto` files. Worse, this workflow is prone to API drift,
where the latest `googleapis` code evolves and is therefore inconsistent with
your local copy. This is exactly what we have in the current `PetStoreService` - the
`google/type/datetime.proto` is copied in order to build the [module](../bsr/overview.md#module).

Now that we have the BSR, this entire workflow simplifies immensely.

## 9.1 Remove `google/type/datetime.proto` {#remove-datetime-proto}

We'll start by removing the `google/type/datetime.proto` file from our module altogether.
From within the `petapis` directory, run the following command:

```terminal
$ rm -rf google
```

Then, remove the `google/type/datetime.proto` reference from your [`buf.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-yaml.md):

```yaml title="buf.yaml" {5-6}
 version: v1
 lint:
   use:
     - DEFAULT
-  ignore:
-    - google/type/datetime.proto
 breaking:
   use:
     - FILE
```

If you try to build the module in its current state, you will notice an error:

```terminal
$ buf build
pet/v1/pet.proto:7:8:google/type/datetime.proto: does not exist
```

## 9.2 Depend on `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis` {#depend-on-googleapis}

We can resolve this error by configuring a dependency in your `buf.yaml`'s `deps` key.
The `google/type/datetime.proto` file is provided by the `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis`
module, so we can configure it like so:

```yaml title="buf.yaml" {2-3}
 version: v1
+deps:
+  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
 lint:
   use:
     - DEFAULT
 breaking:
   use:
     - FILE
```

Now, if you try to build the module again, you'll notice the following:

```terminal
$ buf build
WARN	Specified deps are not covered in your buf.lock, run "buf mod update":
	- buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
pet/v1/pet.proto:7:8:google/type/datetime.proto: does not exist
```

`buf` detected that we specified a dependency that isn't included in the module's [`buf.lock`](../configuration/v1/buf-lock.md)
file, which is your module's dependency manifest, and represents a single, reproducible build
of your module's dependencies. We don't even have a `buf.lock` file yet, but we can create one with
the command that `buf` recommended above:

```terminal
$ buf mod update
```

The `buf mod update` command updates all of your `deps` to their latest version. The generated `buf.lock`
will look similar to the following (the `commit`, `digest`, and `create_time` may vary):

```yaml title="buf.lock"
# Generated by buf. DO NOT EDIT.
version: v1
deps:
  - remote: buf.build
    owner: googleapis
    repository: googleapis
    branch: main
    commit: 1c473ad9220a49bca9320f4cc690eba5
    digest: b1-unlhrcI3tnJd0JEGuOb692LZ_tY_gCGq6mK1bgCn1Pg=
    create_time: ...
```

Now, if we try to build the module again, you'll notice that it's successful:

```terminal
$ buf build
buf: downloading buf.build/googleapis/googleapis:1c473ad9220a49bca9320f4cc690eba5
```

This is the BSR's dependency management in action! A few things happened here, so let's break it down:

  1. `buf` noticed that a new dependency was added to the `deps` key.
  2. `buf` resolved the latest version of the `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis` module, and wrote it to the
      module's `buf.lock`.
  3. When another `buf` command is run, `buf` downloads the `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis` module to the
     local [module cache](../bsr/overview.md#module-cache).
  4. Finally, now that `buf` has all of the dependencies it needs, it can successfully build the module
     (as `google/type/datetime.proto` is included).

In summary, `buf` is able to resolve the dependencies specified in your `buf.yaml`'s `deps` key, and include
the imports required to build your module. **You don't have to manually copy `.proto` files anymore!**

## 9.3 Pin Your Dependencies {#pin-your-dependencies}

You can pin to a specific tag or commit by specifying it in your `deps` after the `:` delimiter. For example,
if you want to depend on the same commit we resolved above and prevent `buf` from updating it in the future,
you can specify it like so:

```yaml title="buf.yaml" {3-4}
 version: v1
 deps:
-  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
+  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis:d75c1d1eb41c490aa9b0b9e7f41dbd02
 lint:
   use:
     - DEFAULT
 breaking:
   use:
     - FILE
```

This is **not recommended** in general since you should _always_ be able to update to the latest version of
your dependencies if they remain backwards compatible. However, in some situations it is unavoidable.
With that said, restore the `buf.yaml` file to its previous state before we continue:

```yaml title="buf.yaml" {3-4}
 version: v1
 deps:
-  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis:d75c1d1eb41c490aa9b0b9e7f41dbd02
+  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
 lint:
   use:
     - DEFAULT
 breaking:
   use:
     - FILE
```

## 9.4 Push Your Changes {#push-your-changes}

Now that we've updated our module to depend on `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis` instead of vendoring
the `google/type/datetime.proto` ourselves, we can push the module to the BSR:

```terminal
$ buf push
b2917eb692064beb92ad1e38dba6c25e
```
