Protobuf enables you to set [file options][file-options] in your `.proto` files that dictate aspects
of how code is generated from those sources. Some file options are required by the [`protoc`][protoc]
compiler, such as [`go_package`](#go_package_prefix) when generating Go code. These options have
been a pain point in Protobuf development for many years because they require API producers to set
values that [don't really belong](#background) in API definitions.

You can avoid setting these file options when [generating] code from Protobuf sources by enabling
**managed mode** in your [`buf.gen.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md) configuration file.
When [enabled](#enabled), the `buf` CLI sets file options *on the fly* according to an opinionated
set of values so that you no longer need to hard-code them.

Managed mode provides options for these languages:

* [C++](#cpp)
* [C#](#csharp)
* [Go](#go)
* [Java](#java)
* [Objective-C](#objective-c)
* [PHP](#php)
* [Ruby](#ruby)

If you're generating code for a language that isn't on this list, managed mode has no implications
and enabling it is likely to have no effect.

## Configuration

To enable managed mode, add the `managed.enabled` option to your [`buf.gen.yaml`][buf-gen-yaml]
configuration. Here's an example configuration that uses the `protoc-gen-java` [plugin][plugins]:

```yaml title="buf.gen.yaml"
version: v1
managed:
  enabled: true
plugins:
  - name: java
    out: gen/proto/java
```

With `enabled` set to `true`, you can remove [Java](#java)-specific file options from the Protobuf
files covered by this configuration and let the `buf` CLI inject those values instead.


> Managed mode only supports the standard file options included in Protobuf by default. It's impossible for `buf` to establish an opinion
> for the custom options you might define, so such options still need to be checked into your Protobuf source files.

### `managed`

The `managed` key is used to configure managed mode. Here's a complete example of a `managed`
configuration with the `protoc-gen-go` plugin:

```yaml title="buf.gen.yaml"
version: v1
managed:
  enabled: true
  optimize_for: CODE_SIZE # Applies to Java
  override:
    JAVA_PACKAGE:
      acme/weather/v1/weather.proto: "org"
  cc_enable_arenas: false
  go_package_prefix:
    default: github.com/acme/weather/private/gen/proto/go
    except:
      - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
    override:
      buf.build/acme/weather: github.com/acme/weather/gen/proto/go
  java_multiple_files: false
  java_package_prefix: com
  java_string_check_utf8: false
plugins:
  - name: go
    out: gen/proto/go
    opt: paths=source_relative
```

#### `enabled`

The `enabled` key is **required** if *any* other `managed` keys are set. Setting `enabled` equal to `true`
enables managed mode according to [default behavior](#default-behavior).

#### `optimize_for`

The `optimize_for` key is **optional** and dictates which [`optimize_for`][optimize_for] is applied
in the Protobuf files covered by the configuration. The `optimize_for` setting applies to both
[C++](#cpp) and [Java](#java) but may effect other plugins. Accepted values:

Value | Description | Default
:-----|:------------|:-------
`SPEED` | Generate highly optimized code for parsing, serializing, and performing common operations on messages | âœ…
`CODE_SIZE` | Generate minimal classes and instead rely on shared, reflection-based code for serialization, parsing, and other operations |
`LITE_RUNTIME` | Generate classes that depend only on the "lite" Protobuf runtime |

##### `default`

The `default` key is **required** if the `go_package_prefix` key is set. The `default` value is used as a prefix for the
`go_package` value set in each of the files. The `default` value **must** be a relative filepath that **must not** jump context
from the current directory, that is they must be subdirectories relative to the current working directory. As an example,
`../external` is invalid.

In the configuration example shown above, the `github.com/acme/weather/gen/proto/go` prefix is *joined* with the given Protobuf
file's relative path from the module root. In the `buf.build/acme/weather` module's case, the `acme/weather/v1/weather.proto`
file would have this `go_package` set:

```protobuf title="acme/weather/v1/weather.proto"
syntax = "proto3";

package acme.weather.v1;

option go_package = "github.com/acme/weather/gen/proto/go/acme/weather/v1;weatherv1";
```

> If the Protobuf file's package declaration conforms to the `PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX` lint rule, the final two path elements are
> concatenated and included after the `;` element in the `go_package` result. The above example generates a Go package with a package
> declaration equal to `weatherv1`, which enables you to import Go definitions from a variety of generated packages that would otherwise
> collide (a lot of Protobuf packages contain the `v1` suffix, for example).

##### `except`

The `except` key is **optional**, and removes certain modules from the `go_package` file option override behavior. The `except` values **must**
be valid [module names](../bsr/overview.md#modules).

There are situations where you may want to enable managed mode for the `go_package` option in *most* of your Protobuf files, but not necessarily
for *all* of your Protobuf files. This is particularly relevant for the `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis` module, which points its `go_package` value to
an [external repository](https://github.com/googleapis/go-genproto). Popular libraries, such as [grpc-go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go) depend on these
`go_package` values, so it's important that managed mode doesn't overwrite them.

##### `override`

The `override` key is **optional**, and overrides the `go_package` file option value used for specific modules. The `override` keys **must** be valid
module names. Additionally, the corresponding `override` values **must** be a valid [Go import path][go.import]
and **must not** jump context from the current directory. As an example, `../external` is invalid.

This setting is used for [workspace](../reference/workspaces.md) environments, where you have a module that imports from another module in the same workspace, and
you need to generate the Go code for each module in different directories. This is particularly relevant for repositories that decouple their private API
definitions from their public API definitions (as is the case for `buf`).

#### `override`

This is a list of per-file overrides for each modifier. In the example provided above, an override for `acme/weather/v1/weather.proto` is set for the `java_package_prefix`
modifier to be `org` instead of `com`. This sets `org` as the package prefix for **only** the specific `acme/weather/v1/weather.proto` file and **not** for the rest of the module.

## Managed mode example {#example}

Take this `weather.proto` definition as an example:

For example, enabling [managed mode](../generate/managed-mode.md) for the `acme/weather/v1/weather.proto` file sets its file options to this:

```protobuf title="acme/weather/v1/weather.proto"
syntax = "proto3";

package acme.weather.v1;

option csharp_namespace = "Acme.Weather.V1";
option go_package = "github.com/acme/weather/gen/proto/go/acme/weather/v1;weatherv1";
option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_outer_classname = "WeatherProto";
option java_package = "com.acme.weather.v1";
option objc_class_prefix = "AWX";
option php_namespace = "Acme\\Weather\\V1";
option php_metadata_namespace = "Acme\\Weather\\V1\\GPBMetadata";
option ruby_package = "Acme::Weather::V1";
```

Some options, such as [`cc_enable_arenas`][cc_enable_arenas] and [`optimize_for`][optimize_for]

> Some options, such as `cc_enable_arenas` and `optimize_for`, are excluded from this list because
> the Buf team agrees with the default values specified by [`google/protobuf/descriptor.go`][descriptor.go].
> If you disagree with the default values, you can override these option values, which is described in the [next section](#file-option-overrides).

## File option overrides

You might find that several of the options set by managed mode are not what you want. This is particularly relevant for options that
influence the content of the generated code, and are less focused on the generated package and/or file layout (such as `java_package`).
For this reason, managed mode enables users override the values of several options, including `cc_enable_arenas`, `java_multiple_files`,
`java_string_check_utf8`, and `optimize_for`.

You can configure each of these options under the `managed` key like this:

```yaml title="buf.gen.yaml"
version: v1
managed:
  enabled: true
  cc_enable_arenas: false
  java_multiple_files: false
  java_string_check_utf8: false
  optimize_for: CODE_SIZE
plugins:
  - name: java
    out: gen/proto/java
```

## Languages

### C++ {#cpp}

#### `cc_enable_arenas`

The `cc_enable_arenas` key is **optional**, and controls what the [`cc_enable_arenas`][cc_enable_arenas]
value is set to in all of the files in the generation target [Input]. Accepted values
are `false` and `true`, with `false` as the default.

#### `optimize_for` {#optimize_for-cpp}

You can set [`optimize_for`](#optimize_for) for C++ using managed mode.

### C# {#csharp}

If you enable managed mode, [`csharp_namespace`][csharp_namespace] is set to the package name with
each package sub-name capitalized.

### Go

#### `go_package_prefix`

The `go_package_prefix` key is **optional**, and controls what the [`go_package`][go_package]
value is set to in all the files contained within the generation target input.

### Java

#### `optimize_for` {#optimize_for-java}

You can set [`optimize_for`](#optimize_for) for Java using managed mode.

#### `java_multiple_files`

The `java_multiple_files` key is **optional**, and controls what the
[`java_multiple_files`][java_multiple_files] value is set to in all of the files contained within
the generation target input. Accepted values are `false` and `true`, with `true` as the default.

#### `java_package_prefix`

The `java_package_prefix` key is **optional**, and controls what the [`java_package`][java_package]
prefix value is set to in all of the files contained within the generation target input. The default
value is `com`.

#### `java_outer_classname`

If you enable managed mode, [`java_outer_classname`][java_outer_classname] is set to the
[PascalCase][pascal]-equivalent of the file's name, removing the `.` from the `.proto` extension.

#### `java_string_check_utf8`

The `java_string_check_utf8` key is **optional** and controls the value of
[`java_string_check_utf8`][java_string_check_utf8] in all of the files contained within the
generation target Input. Accepted values are `false` and `true`, with `false` as the default.

### Objective-C

For Objective-C, enabling managed mode means that [`objc_class_prefix`][objc_class_prefix] is set to
the uppercase first letter of each package sub-name, not including the package version, with these rules:

* If the resulting abbreviation is 2 characters, `X` is added.
* If the resulting abbreviation is 1 character, `XX` is added.
* If the resulting abbreviation is `GPB`, it's changed to `GPX`, as `GPB` is reserved by Google for
  the Protocol Buffers implementation.

### PHP

If you enable managed mode:

* [`php_namespace`][php_namespace] is set to the package name with each package sub-name
  capitalized, with `\\` substituted for `.`.
* [`php_metadata_namespace`][php_metadata_namespace] is set to the same value as `php_namespace`,
  with `\\GPBMetadata` appended.

### Ruby

If you enable managed mode, [`ruby_package`][ruby_package] is set to the package name with each
package sub-name capitalized, with `::` substituted for `.`.

## Background

One drawback of Protobuf development using the original [`protoc`][protoc] compiler is that you need
to hard-code some file options into your `.proto` files when generating code for some languages.
Take this `weather.proto` file inside of this file tree, for example:

```protobuf title="acme/weather/v1/weather.proto"
syntax = "proto3";

package acme.weather.v1;

option go_package = "github.com/acme/weather/gen/proto/go/acme/weather/v1;weatherv1";
option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_outer_classname = "WeatherProto";
option java_package = "com.acme.weather.v1";
```

```sh
.
â”œâ”€â”€ acme
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ weather
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ v1
â”‚Â Â          â””â”€â”€ weather.proto
â””â”€â”€ buf.yaml
```

Notice that four file options are set here:

* [`go_package`](#go_package_prefix)
* [`java_multiple_files`](#java_multiple_files)
* [`java_outer_classname`](#java_outer_classname)
* [`java_package`](#java_package_prefix)

But none of these options have anything to do with the _actual API definition_ in Protobuf, which
makes them API _consumer_ concerns rather than API _producer_ concerns. Different consumers may want
to use different values for these options. A Java developer, for example, may want to specify a
[`java_package`](#java_package_prefix) that matches their organization.

The problem really comes to a head when it comes to import paths. With [`protoc`][protoc], a Go
developer, for example, would need to invoke the [`--go_opt`](#go_opt) flag when generating code,
for example `--go_opt=Mpath/to/foo.proto=github.com/pkg/foo`, to specify the import path.
But with the `buf` CLI and managed mode, 

None of these options have anything to do with the API definition within Protobuf - they are all API *consumer* concerns, not API *producer* concerns.
Different consumers may (and usually do) want different values for these options, especially when a given set of Protobuf definitions is consumed in
many different places. This gets especially bad with imports - anyone in Go who has had to specify long chains of `--go_opt=Mpath/to/foo.proto=github.com/pkg/foo`
can attest to the severity of the situation.
