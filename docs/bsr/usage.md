To execute `buf` commands below make sure you are [authenticated](../bsr/authentication.md). Obtain a token from the BSR and run:

```terminal
$ buf registry login
```

Follow the prompts to enter your username and password (API Token). This adds an entry into your `$HOME/.netrc` (Linux or macOS) or `%HOME%/_netrc` (Windows).

## Push a Module

The only requirement to push to the BSR is to have a module that [builds](../build/usage.md)
successfully, meaning that you should be able to run `buf build` successfully on your module.

Before you can push a module into the BSR there needs to exist a repository, owned by either a user or an organization, the user has access to. A repository can be created either through the UI or from the command line with `buf`.

If you want to collaborate with other users on a module, select an organization as the owner of the repository.

**1. Create a Repository**

Through the **UI** log in at [https://buf.build/login](https://buf.build/login) and navigate to Your repositories and click **Create Repository**. Select an owner for the repository and give it a repository name. The visibility can be either public or private.

Alternatively, use the **CLI** run this command:

```terminal
$ buf beta registry repository create <MODULE_NAME> --visibility [public,private]
```

The module name takes the form `<remote>/<owner>/<repository_name>` (for example, `buf.build/acme/weather`).<br/>
The `--visibility` flag is **required** and must be one of: `private` or `public`.

**2. Configure a name**

You'll need to configure your `buf.yaml` file to match the BSR repository. To do so, add the module name as a `name` key:

```yaml title=buf.yaml {2}
version: v1
name: buf.build/acme/weather
```

**3. Push to the Repository**

Push your module to the BSR by running this command:

```terminal
$ buf push
```

This command returns the commit reference.

One of the main benefits of a centralized, Protobuf-aware registry is you're guaranteed not to push
broken modules. This means that consumers can have confidence that modules hosted on the BSR
always compile.

Suppose we mistyped an identifier:

```proto {5}
syntax = "proto3";

package units.v1;

messag Metric {
    int64 other = 1;
}
```

If we try to `buf push` to the BSR we'll get an immediate error:

```
Failure: units/v1/metric.proto:5:1:syntax error: unexpected identifier.
```

Sure you can have CI workflows to automatically catch compilation errors, but by using the BSR these guarantees are made available to everyone out-of-the-box.

That's it. This module can now be consumed as a first class dependency and its [autogenerated documentation](documentation.mdx) can be viewed on the BSR.

## Add a Dependency

If, for example, you are using one of the files from the [googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis) repository in your Protobuf files, and you're having to copy files into your local Protobuf generation tree, you can instead use `buf` to manage this dependency for you.

To include dependencies in your build add the `deps` key to your `buf.yaml` file and list the modules your build depends on. Example:

```yaml title=buf.yaml {2,3}
version: v1
deps:
    - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
lint:
  use:
    - DEFAULT
breaking:
  use:
    - FILE
```

After adding dependencies in `buf.yaml` run this command:

```terminal
$ buf mod update
```

This updates all your `deps` to their latest version and gets captured in a `buf.lock` file. You do not need to make any changes to this file and if using a version control system, commit it along with your Protobuf files.

```yaml title=buf.lock
# Generated by buf. DO NOT EDIT.
version: v1
deps:
  - remote: buf.build
    owner: googleapis
    repository: googleapis
    branch: main
    commit: 1c473ad9220a49bca9320f4cc690eba5
    digest: b1-unlhrcI3tnJd0JEGuOb692LZ_tY_gCGq6mK1bgCn1Pg=
    create_time: ...
```

Once your dependencies are updated, you can run `buf build` and the `buf` CLI resolves hosted module dependencies by leveraging the BSR.

## Code generation

The BSR facilitates both local and remote code generation, simplifying how module consumers get access to generated code. This is especially useful for **clients** that need to generate an SDK to consume a Protobuf-based API in their language of choice.

### Local code generation

The `buf generate` command allows you to run local plugins to generate code from remote modules hosted on the BSR. If you already have a workflow that invokes plugins with `protoc` then adopting `buf generate` should be straightforward.

Add a `buf.gen.yaml` file and list all the plugins as well as their options. Here is a quick example that generates C++ and Java code.

```yaml title=buf.gen.yaml
version: v1
plugins:
  - name: cpp
    out: gen/proto/cpp
  - name: java
    out: gen/proto/java
```

The `buf` CLI infers the `protoc-gen-{name}` prefix for each plugin specified by the `name` key, similar to `protoc` behaviour.

Once you set up a `buf.gen.yaml` file, run this command and specify a module hosted on the BSR. That's right, you can reference a hosted BSR module without having the Protobuf files locally!

```terminal
$ buf generate <MODULE_NAME>
```

This generates C++ and Java code in the local `/gen/proto/{cpp,java}` directories.

> For a more advanced example, check out the [Tour - Generate Go Code](../tour/generate-go-code.md)

### Remote code generation

If you don't want to manage plugins and generate code manually, and instead would prefer to simply consume generated code, check out the experimental [Remote Code Generation](../bsr/remote-generation/overview.md) section.

### Deprecate or Undeprecate a Repository

BSR repositories can be deprecated. `buf` warns you when you run `buf mod update` on a module that depends on a 
deprecated repository.

You can deprecate a repository with

```terminal
$ buf beta registry repository deprecate <buf.build/owner/repository> [--message <deprecation message>]
```

Undeprecate a deprecated repository with

```terminal
$ buf beta registry repository undeprecate <buf.build/owner/repository>
```
